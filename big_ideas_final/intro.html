    <h1>How Altself Works</h1>
    <p>
      Altself AI is a next-generation digital proxy designed to seamlessly integrate into your online communication and task management. 
      Through continuous observation of your digital patterns — including email habits, social media tone, response frequency, and preferred platforms — Altself builds a behavioral model unique to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, Altself calibrates by passively monitoring your interactions, gradually learning your style and preferences. Over time, it starts drafting responses, managing messages, and handling routine tasks on your behalf. 
      Eventually, Altself becomes capable of autonomous operation, continuing to represent your digital presence even in your absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      By leveraging both algorithmic pattern recognition and optional neural input devices, Altself aims to create a more authentic, context-aware AI proxy that adapts as you evolve.
