                The experience of presenting my final project to the class
                was immensely rewarding, and the generous feedback I
                received has provided me with valuable insights for artistic
                growth!
              </p>
              <p>
                This was my first time making a project that
                consists of integration of physical objects with online games.
                One response that echoed through
                the notes was the powerful effect of sharing personal childhood
                experiences. It was heartening to discover that my narrative
                resonated universally, evoking emotions in others who may not
                have shared similar experiences. I am committed to
                refining and enhancing this aspect. I plan to make the hints
                more obvious and introduce context in the physical setting,
                ensuring a more engaging experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am
                grateful to everyone who took the time to offer insights and
                advice. Your encouragement and feedback fuel my drive to keep
                pushing my artistic boundaries!
