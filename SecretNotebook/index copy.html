                The Secret Notebook is an interactive project designed by Claire Zhou. The theme of this project is to awaken an old memory about a
                lady’s childhood through three little online puzzles. Claire ended up
                using both physical objects and p5js sketches to lead the player
                to “retrieve their memories.” After solving each puzzle, a
                digital illustration with one number will appear. At last, the
                player can open the notebook and see a tiny animation with
                Eyejack.

                You are a young lady who accidentally finds a box with old items
                in it while preparing to move to your new apartment. When you
                open it, you found a postcard, a picture frame, a stack of
                papers and a locked notebook. You recognized it as your
                childhood diary, but you forgot the password to open it.
                Fortunately, you got a few clues from the other three
                objects......

                Claire was inspired by a video on the Tiktok about a person who
                forgets the password to his childhood password notebook and
                violently opened the password notebook in order to read the
                content in it. This video triggered her own memories of her own
                password notebook and led me to create this game about her
                childhood memories. Through this game, she want to express that
                the childhood had slipped away before we knew it, and it would
                never return.

                This project requires interaction in order to be completed and
                requires the player to scan the QR code with their phone.The
                three items in the game have different QR codes on them, and
                each QR code corresponds to a different puzzle made with p5js.
                For the classroom presentation, Claire will have classmates split
                into 3 groups to solve each of the three puzzles and get the
                three numbers separately. Finally, after figuring out the order
                of three numbers, she will enter the numbers into the lock, and
                the notebook will be unlocken.
