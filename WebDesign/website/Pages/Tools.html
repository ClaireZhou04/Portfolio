    <p>The <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/d/db/Ong_Walter_J_Orality_and_Literacy_2nd_ed.pdf">psychodynamics of Computational media</a> is about what effects would Computational media have on people’s inner thoughts and how different ways of media have different effects on people. Blogs, television or books convey information more slowly than TikTok videos since videos often show quick, direct messages that don’t require people to spend time processing. One thing I found really interesting is the different effects that media has. Blogs and e-books are attempting to promote linear thinking, while television emphasizes emotional and pictorial thinking. They not only changed our thinking patterns, but also the way how society and culture are structured.</p>

    <div class="g3">
    <p>In my perspective, after the oral and written culture, the culture made up of computational media would be fast-paced and hard to unify. One feeling I have when surfing the internet is that messages are coming and passing too fast. If you stop watching social media for a month, when you return, you will find that people are talking about brand-new topics that you have never heard of. People see something, people talk about it, then people forget it.</p>
  
     <p>Besides, the culture shaped by computational media would be more “unnormal”. This is because people on social media hide their real identity from the public, which makes them more open to sharing thoughts and feelings that are normally being judged as abnormal. For instance, on Chinese social media, two popular phrases that are used by young people to describe their mindset: “Lay down” and “Go mad”. The first one means that they are unwilling to compete with others anymore, and the latter one means that they are too tired or too stressed to stay calm. In the past, such statements would not have been allowed on television or in newspapers because they would have been seen as promoting incorrect ideas. But these days, in an online environment that has much less control, such descriptions are flooding everywhere. Another powerful example is the widespread unwillingness of young people to have children on the Internet (apparently this is not the common story for people of the last generation). Moreover, people would have completely different thinking even if they are using the same media platform. I think nowadays the media have a strong ability to feature the tastes of their customers. For example, videos that my TikTok recommended to me are totally different from what it offered to my grandma. Even people of the same age would have completely different tastes. In this way, I believe that computers are actually promoting the fragmentation of culture.</p>

   <div class="g5">
     <p>However, I don’t think this is an example of dysfunctional technology. Freedom of speech is a right that is easy to give but difficult to take back. We should accept that our common stories are no longer common, and we should understand and adjust the issues raised, not block them.</p>
