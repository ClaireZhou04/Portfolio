        <p>In the video <a href="https://youtu.be/cFwVCHkL-JU?feature=shared/">“This Is Marshall McLuhan – The Medium Is The Massage (1967),”</a> Marshall McLuhan talks about how media changes affected people’s life and their perceptions. Instead of only analyzing the influence of media on overall society, McLuhan breaks down the society into several parts. Although people have believed that the information contained by the media is more important, McLuhan reveals that it is the media which changes how people perceive the world. He also mentions hot and cool media, as he states that movies, radio, and newspapers are hot media while TV is a cool media. I believe that the change of media does change the information that’s been presented. When people were using newspapers as the way of getting information, what they get are mainly official news that happened within one city or a huge event happened in the country, but what people get from the internet every day contains more small but fun things that happened to other people. The invention of the internet certainly helped people to know more about themselves and other people as individual human beings.</p>

        <p>Then McLuhan expressed the information explosion in the world and the concept of Global Village. Electronic devices break down the walls between countries and cultures, and take away people’s privacy. Media also serves as the extension of the human body. For example, wheels can be considered as the extension of feet, TV can be the extension of eyes, and electronic circuits are just like our nervous system.</p>

      <div class="p5">
         <p>McLuhan points out that when a new technology appears, people’s first reaction is to go back to old ones and stay in their comfort zones. This is somehow correlated with the ideas in Steven Johnson’s book “Where Good Ideas Come From,” as he says that a new technology may take 10 years to be accepted by the public. However, artists are a group of people who enjoy living in the present and embrace new technology into their works. The technology changes also affected the culture of music, as musicians started to add rhythms of popular speech into their music.The participation of the audience is a new factor raised by the technology changes. Before the invention of the internet, people had little chance to participate in the things they see on TV. </p>

      <div class="p6">
         <p>McLuhan states that to business managers, storyboarding is more valuable than the final project, as the incomplete form allows more participation than the complete one. If a work has no story line or is not clear enough, it requires the audience to participate more to figure it out. Advertisement producers care a lot about audience’s attention and participation, therefore they apply different techniques to improve the participation, and many of them have affected the production of films.</p>
